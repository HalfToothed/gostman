## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage 

### Project Management

Gostman automatically manages API collections per project directory:
1. When you run `gostman`, it checks for a `gostman.json` file in your current directory
2. If found, it automatically loads that project's requests
3. If not found, it prompts you to create a new project or use an existing one
4. Each directory can have its own collection of API requests

### Environment Variables

Use environment variables to make your requests dynamic:
1. Press **Ctrl + E** to open the environment editor
2. Define variables in JSON format: `{"baseUrl": "https://api.example.com"}`
3. Use variables in requests with double braces: `{{baseUrl}}/users`
